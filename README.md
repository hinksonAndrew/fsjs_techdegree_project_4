OOP Game Show App

Using OOP concepts learned in Unit 4 I made a game show app that is similar to hangman. You can either click on the on-screen qwerty keyboard or use your physical keyboard to select letters. 5 missed letters and your done. 

Game Theme: Movie Quotes

For extra credit I also used the included animate.css file and added some super fancy "pulse" and "rotateIn" animations directly to the styles.css file. I also changed the colors of the letters for when they are correct or wrong.
